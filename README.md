## Objective

In this project, I intend to create an engaging and responsive website. The goal of this website is to illustrate my passion for going to concerts, and to allow other users to do the same thing by sharing their experiences. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities using HTML, CSS, Python, Flask and MongoDB, creating an enjoyable experience for users of the website.

The target audience for this website is people who are similar to myself - people who love going to concerts and watching live music.

### Initial Concept

The concept for this website was very much functionality first, focusing on a good, functional user experience, whilst keeping the design visually appealing but simplistic, maintaining appropriate contrast throughout the website. The design should be kept distraction-free, focusing on the content created by the users, rather than the website itself. 

#### Wireframes

For initially designing the project, I utilised Balsamiq to produce wireframes. This step allows for planning layouts and page structures, allowing to focus more on the website looking like the designs, instead of trying to simultaneously code and design.

- [Home Page Logged In Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/home_page_logged_in_wireframe.png)
- [Registration Page Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/registration_page_wireframe.png)
- [Login Page Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/login_page_wireframe.png)
- [All Posts Page Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/all_posts_page_wireframe.png)
- [Post Page Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/post_page_wireframe.png)
- [Add Post Page Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/add_post_page_wireframe.png)
- [Categories Page Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/categories_page_wireframe.png)
- [Categories Page Administrator View Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/categories_page_administrator_wireframe.png)
- [Add Category Page Wireframe](./static/images/documentation/add_category_page_wireframe.png)

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this project involved a lot of trial and error. I was interested in potentially using a background image for the home page, but I did not have a clear vision on what it would have been, so I decided against it. I experimented with different colour combinations, using Coolors for inspiration.

The colours used throughout this website are:
- Navigation Bar: Red `#CC2936`
- Cards: Grey `#333138`
- Background: Black `#000103`
- Buttons: Styled using Bootstrap's primary (blue), secondary (grey), info (turquoise), and danger (red) classes
- Text: White `#fff`

#### Typography

The typography for this project was picked using Google Fonts.
- Main Brand / Logo: Poetsen One
- Other Text: IBM Plex Sans
